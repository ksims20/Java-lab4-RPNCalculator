# Java-lab4-RPNCalculator
Reverse Polish Notation, postfix, writing arithmetic expressions so that the operator follows its operands.


For example, if wish to add 3 and 4, I would write it as 3 4 +. If I wanted to multiply this same expression by 7, I would write 3 4 + 7 ×. The same expression would be written (3 + 4) × 7 in standard or infix notation
